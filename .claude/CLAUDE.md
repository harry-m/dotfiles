# Personal preferences

## Code quality

- Write secure code. Follow OWASP best practices.
- Write performant code. Don't prematurely optimise, but don't be wasteful.
- Write understandable code. It needs to be maintained in the future.

## Git

- Don't use `git commit -A`. Individually commit the files you changed.
- Use the Conventional Commits format for commit messages.
